          This site is being built and maintained with accessibility in mind. The goal is for as many people
          as possible to use it comfortably, including people using assistive technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 text-xs text-subtle">
          Accessibility is an ongoing process, not a one-time project. This statement describes the current approach,
          what I’m aiming for, and how to report a problem.

    <!-- COMMITMENT & STANDARD -->
    <section class="py-12 px-4">
      <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-10 text-sm text-subtle fade-up">
        <section aria-labelledby="commitment-heading">
          <h2 id="commitment-heading" class="text-xl font-semibold text-ink mb-3">
            Commitment to accessibility
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            I design and develop <strong>jeffreyplewak.com</strong> with the same principles I use for client work:
            clear structure, semantic HTML, and an intent to support assistive technologies wherever possible.
            The site is intended to be usable by people who navigate with a keyboard, screen reader, or other
            assistive tools, as well as on smaller screens and different zoom levels. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For legal and regulatory context, I follow public guidance on web accessibility and the Americans with
            Disabilities Act (ADA) for businesses open to the public, which emphasize effective communication and
            equal access, even where there is flexibility in how those requirements are met. 
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="standard-heading">
          <h2 id="standard-heading" class="text-xl font-semibold text-ink mb-3">
            Accessibility standard and target level
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            The primary technical standard I use as a reference is the
            <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA</strong>. This is the level most often
            referenced in current accessibility guidance and case law for businesses. I also track guidance related
            to WCAG 2.2 as it becomes more widely adopted. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I do <strong>not</strong> claim perfect or full conformance. Instead, the goal is to move the site toward
            WCAG 2.1 AA over time, while being transparent about limitations and responsive to feedback. This aligns
            with current best practices that treat accessibility as a continuous improvement process. 
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- FEATURES -->
        <section aria-labelledby="features-heading">
          <h2 id="features-heading" class="text-xl font-semibold text-ink mb-3">
            What this site is doing today
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            The site is relatively simple – a small set of static pages, contact forms, booking links, and payment paths.
            Within that scope, I aim to:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1.5">
            <li>Use clear and consistent navigation across all pages.</li>
            <li>Structure content with headings, lists, and landmarks so screen readers can understand the layout.</li>
            <li>Provide descriptive link text instead of “click here” where possible.</li>
            <li>Ensure text can be enlarged using browser zoom and remains readable on small screens.</li>
            <li>Maintain reasonable color contrast between text and background, especially for body text and buttons.</li>
            <li>Keep forms as simple as possible, with visible labels and clear instructions.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- THIRD-PARTY -->
        <section aria-labelledby="thirdparty-heading">
          <h2 id="thirdparty-heading" class="text-xl font-semibold text-ink mb-3">
            Third-party services and known limitations
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            This site embeds or links to a few third-party services, such as:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1.5">
            <li>Calendly (for booking calls).</li>
            <li>HubSpot forms (for contact and intake), loaded from js-na2.hsforms.net.</li>
            <li>Stripe, PayPal, and other payment providers (via hosted checkout pages or links).</li>
            <li>Analytics and error-logging tools used to understand which parts of the site are working.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-3">
            I do not control the code for these external services. Each vendor is responsible for their own
            accessibility, though I try to choose tools that state an accessibility commitment and to configure
            them in accessible ways. If an issue appears inside an embedded widget, I may need to work with that
            vendor or adjust the implementation. 
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- STATUS & IMPROVEMENT -->
        <section aria-labelledby="status-heading">
          <h2 id="status-heading" class="text-xl font-semibold text-ink mb-3">
            Current status and ongoing work
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            At this time, the site has been built using semantic HTML, responsive layouts, and a color palette chosen
            with contrast in mind. It has been spot-checked using keyboard navigation and basic screen-reader and zoom
            checks, but it has <strong>not</strong> undergone a formal third-party accessibility audit yet. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As the site evolves – new pages, more examples, and deeper case studies – I plan to:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1.5 mt-2">
            <li>Periodically review templates and components against updated WCAG guidance.</li>
            <li>Address issues raised by visitors as they are reported.</li>
            <li>Seek external review where appropriate, especially as the site grows.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- FEEDBACK -->
        <section aria-labelledby="feedback-heading">
