        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="small subtle">
          Last updated: November 2025 · This page explains how this site handles your data in plain language.
          It is not formal legal advice.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Who runs this site</h2>
        <p>
          This site is run by me, <strong>Jeffrey Plewak</strong>, as an independent consultant.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          Contact: <a href="mailto:plewak.jeff@gmail.com">plewak.jeff@gmail.com</a>
        </p>

        <h2>2. What this site does</h2>
        <p>
          This site is a simple marketing and booking site for my consulting work. It lets you:
        </p>
        <ul class="features">
          <li>Read about services and pricing.</li>
          <li>Book a call via Calendly.</li>
          <li>Send a message via a contact form (backed by HubSpot CRM).</li>
          <li>Pay for services via Stripe Buy Buttons.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. What data is collected</h2>
        <p>There are three main categories of data:</p>
        <h3>3.1 Data you actively submit</h3>
        <ul class="features">
          <li>
            <strong>Contact forms (HubSpot):</strong> When you send a message through the contact form,
            HubSpot collects the fields shown (for example name, email, message) and stores them in
            my HubSpot CRM account so I can respond and track follow-ups.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Booking (Calendly):</strong> When you schedule a call, Calendly collects details such as
            your name, email, and chosen time to create calendar events and reminders.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payments (Stripe):</strong> When you pay through a Stripe Buy Button, Stripe collects
            payment details and billing information to process the transaction. I do not see full card numbers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Technical and usage data</h3>
        <ul class="features">
          <li>
            <strong>Hosting logs (Vercel and related infrastructure):</strong> When you visit the site,
            standard web server logs may record your IP address, browser type, and basic request information.
            These logs are used for security, reliability, and abuse prevention.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Basic usage information:</strong> Depending on how analytics are configured, anonymised
            metrics (such as page views and referrers) may be collected to understand which pages are used.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="cookies">3.3 Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
        <p>
          This site uses cookies and similar technologies to run basic features and, optionally,
          analytics or marketing. The banner at the bottom of the page lets you choose your preferences.
        </p>
        <ul class="features">
          <li>
            <strong>Strictly necessary:</strong> Required for security, basic navigation, and for some
            third-party tools (for example Stripe) to work properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance:</strong> Optional analytics to understand which pages are used and how.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketing / targeting:</strong> Only relevant if I later enable remarketing or ads;
            none are currently used by default.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          You can update your preferences at any time using the cookie controls when they are shown.
        </p>

        <h2>4. How your data is used</h2>
        <p>Your data is used only to:</p>
        <ul class="features">
          <li>Respond to your messages and questions.</li>
          <li>Schedule and run calls or meetings you request.</li>
          <li>Process payments and keep basic financial records.</li>
          <li>Maintain site security and prevent abuse.</li>
          <li>Understand which pages are working or need improvement (if analytics are enabled).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I do not sell your data to third parties. Data is shared only with the service providers
          needed to run the site and deliver services (for example HubSpot, Calendly, Stripe, hosting).
        </p>

        <h2>5. Where your data is stored</h2>
        <p>
          Data may be processed and stored in data centers operated by the services used, which may
          be located in the United States or other regions. These providers have their own security
          and compliance programs.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Third-party services used</h2>
        <p>
          This site uses several third-party providers. Their handling of your data is also governed
          by their own privacy policies:
        </p>
        <ul class="features">
          <li>Hosting and deployment platforms (for example Vercel or similar).</li>
          <li>Stripe (payments and checkout).</li>
          <li>Calendly (scheduling and calendar invites).</li>
          <li>HubSpot (contact forms and CRM).</li>
          <li>Optional analytics providers if enabled in the future.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          Data is kept for as long as it is reasonably needed for the purposes above:
          responding to you, running projects, keeping basic business records, and complying with
          legal or tax obligations.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your rights and choices</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have rights over your personal data, such as the right
          to access, correct, or request deletion. If you want to exercise these rights, contact me
          at <a href="mailto:plewak.jeff@gmail.com">plewak.jeff@gmail.com</a> with enough information
          to identify your records.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          I may need to keep certain records where there is a legal obligation (for example invoices
          or basic transaction details).
        </p>

        <h2>9. Children</h2>
        <p>
          This site and services are not directed at children. If you believe information about a
          minor has been provided, contact me and I will review and, where appropriate, delete it.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          This policy may be updated from time to time as the site or services change. The “last updated”
          date at the top of the page will always show the current version. Significant changes will be
          reflected on this page.
        </p>

        <h2>11. How to contact me about privacy</h2>
        <p>
          For any privacy-related questions or requests, email
          <a href="mailto:plewak.jeff@gmail.com">plewak.jeff@gmail.com</a>. I aim to respond within a
          reasonable time.
