            <li>Identification and contact details (name, email address, phone number).</li>
            <li>Business details (business name, role, location, website, services offered).</li>

          <p class="mb-3">
            This data may be collected through server logs, first-party analytics, or third-party tools,

            how people use it.

          <h3 class="font-semibold text-ink mb-1 mt-4">3.3 Information from third-party platforms</h3>
          <p>
            If you follow links to other platforms (for example, Upwork, Fiverr, LinkedIn, Calendly, HubSpot-hosted
            forms, or payment providers), those services may share limited information back, such as whether a booking
            or payment was completed. The details are governed by their own privacy policies.
