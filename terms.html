        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="small subtle">
          Last updated: November 2025 · These terms are meant to be clear and readable. They are not formal legal advice.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of these terms</h2>
        <p>
          By using this site, you agree to these terms of use. If you do not agree, please do not
          use the site or submit information through it.
        </p>

        <h2>2. What this site provides</h2>
        <p>
          This site provides information about my services, ways to contact me, options to book
          time, and ways to pay for certain services. Everything is provided on an “as is” and “as
          available” basis.
        </p>

        <h2>3. No guarantees or promises</h2>
        <p>
          I take the work seriously and aim for professional, careful results, but:
        </p>
        <ul class="features">
          <li>The site may change or be unavailable without notice.</li>
          <li>No specific business, legal, or financial results are guaranteed.</li>
          <li>Examples or descriptions of past work do not promise the same outcome for you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Not legal or financial advice</h2>
        <p>
          Content on this site is general information, not legal or financial advice. Any work
          involving compliance, risk, or legal processes is done with care, but decisions about
          legal obligations remain your responsibility and, where applicable, the responsibility
          of your own legal counsel.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Use of the site</h2>
        <p>You agree not to do any of the following:</p>
        <ul class="features">
          <li>Use the site to send spam or abusive content.</li>
          <li>Attempt to disrupt, overload, or attack the site or its infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Try to bypass security measures or access data that is not intended for you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Third-party services and links</h2>
        <p>
          This site relies on third-party tools such as hosting providers, Stripe, Calendly,
          HubSpot, and others. There may also be links to external sites. I do not control these
          services or sites and am not responsible for their content, policies, or availability.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Payments and refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Payments for services are processed by Stripe. Pricing pages and checkout options show
          current pricing and what is included. For specific engagements, scope and terms may be
          agreed in writing (for example by email or separate agreement).
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          If something feels mismatched or you believe there has been a mistake, contact me quickly
          at <a href="mailto:plewak.jeff@gmail.com">plewak.jeff@gmail.com</a> and I will review the
          situation in good faith. Any refund or change is handled case by case.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
          Unless stated otherwise, the content on this site (text, layout, and design) is owned by
          me or used with permission. You may reference the site and share links, but copying or
          re-using substantial portions of content for your own commercial site is not permitted
          without explicit permission.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, I am not liable for any indirect,
          incidental, special, or consequential damages, or for any loss of profits or data arising
          out of or in connection with your use of this site.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          If any liability is found despite the above, it will be limited to the amount you actually
          paid for the relevant service, where applicable.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to these terms</h2>
        <p>
          These terms may be updated from time to time. The “last updated” date at the top of this
          page will always indicate the current version. Continued use of the site after changes
          means you accept the updated terms.
        </p>
